# Stencil Slots and recursivity example

This is a simple component, load and used into an html page, to reproduce a bug when slots are not correctly rendered at the right place by Stencil.

# Start

To start building a new web component using Stencil, clone this repo to a new directory:

git remote rm origin
```

and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To build the component for production, run:

```

```
